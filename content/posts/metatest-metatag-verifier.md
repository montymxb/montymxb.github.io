Verified and checked for proper integration of third party tags can greatly enhance posting and sharing on twitter and facebook.

Metatest was a tool designed to test to apply regular expressions to attempt to parse HTML, which being inherently irregular needed some programming around it to handle some odd cases. The result was an analysis tool that could determine what meta-tags were missing from your site.

Inadvertently, this also turned out to be a handy approach towards verifying the structure of an HTML document.
