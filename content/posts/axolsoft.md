At the beginning of 2015 I started working at a new business called Axolsoft as the Head Software Engineer. I co-founded Axolsoft with partner, and good friend of mine.

The majority of my work was programmer-centric, involving developing a set of internal tools, several online portals, and when possible automating any standardized procedures. Most of the time I was developing systems with:

- PHP / MySQL
- HTML5/CSS/JS
- NGINX
- Stripe & Braintree payments
- Opencart stores
- MyBB Forums
- Mailing Systems leveraging SFP, DKIM, and DMARC for email security

Not to mention that I *also designed the logo*. I was, and still am, very happy with it as well. Originally we wanted a logo resembling an [Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl), a fascinating salamander from Mexico. We believed that, like the rare Axolotl, we were creating something special. We of course wanted software as well, so we added on 'soft' afterwards. To be honest, looking back at it (and based on what I've been told), it does tend to resemble an Eagle more than Axolotl. Still, the imagery was well suited for our work, and for the boldness of starting a small LLC by ourselves.
