Interested in bringing an experienced engineer for consulting or contract work, or simply have a question about something? Feel free to reach out here.

For reference, I have experience in the following fields.

- Full-Stack Software Engineering (PHP, JS, NGINX, Node.js)
- Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- System Development (Haskell, C, C++, Python, Java)
- Data Visualization (OpenGL, GLSL)

I've worked on a number of projects with a *myriad* of languages over the years. Chances are that even if I haven't listed a language or skill above, I still can offer helpful insight for your project.
