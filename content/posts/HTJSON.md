While experimenting with verifying the structure of HTML (from Metatest and Sitecheck before), I went ahead and spent some time to write up a simple parser in php.
This can go through most HTML and convert it into json, which can then be worked on by other programs.

The plan was to utilize this as a step in later building and processing websites as JSON, and then decoding them back into HTML, but I decided to leave it at this.
