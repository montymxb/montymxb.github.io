<p>
	When software causes someone else a problem that's never good.
	If you have had issues with software then send an email. The idea is to improve upon work consistently,
	but things may still be missed. If you believe you have found a bug, issue, or even potential issue please use the link below. 
	Nothing could be better than to ensure software always remains safe and usable.
