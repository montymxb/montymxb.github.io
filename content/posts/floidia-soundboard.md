A simple soundboard application, made up of the leftover components from developing BitShooter. Long since defunct now.

The original idea was to create a *flowing* soundboard, one which allowed dynamic tuning of the sound bytes on the fly. Floidia achieved this by a dynamic OpenGL interface, where users could change the pitch and the volume by dragging a virtual audio stream on the screen. A change in color, and speed, would be shown to help the user associate the physical changes with the auditory ones.

[You can still see the original page for the application here](/Floidia/).
