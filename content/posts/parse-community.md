After Parse went open source, we had already been using their PHP SDK for some time at Axolsoft, and we had to figure how to handle the migration.

Over time I ended up working more on the SDK itself, contributing to it, and eventually taking it on as a project of my own.
It was definitely a lot of fun fixing bugs, introducing features, managing PRs, and bringing the test suite up to spec.
