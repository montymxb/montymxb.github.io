This was my first real foray into programming and developing any kind of application, and it was a really enjoyable one as well! I taught myself Java from near nothing, and flew into more advanced concepts such as OpenGL, OpenAL, and working with multi-threaded code to implement my own physics system.

After publishing the app on Android I wrote a second, identical version for iOS in Obj-C (before Swift existed). This version leveraged CoreData, OpenGL, and a few other advanced features I never thought I would get to try out. Both apps were on their respective stores for some years before I pulled them both down. This was done due to the lack of time I had to develop them further, to keep them up-to-date, and the notion that I was happy with the work I had done --- and I was ready to move on.

Notably the components that I wrote in Bit Shooter found their way into [Hangman Azul](/posts/hangmanazul/), [Floidia](/posts/floidia/), and another unpublished game about *ants* --- but I'm pretty sure I lost the source code to that years ago (sadly).
