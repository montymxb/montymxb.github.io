- Talk about how I (will have) re-written the metatest tool, and the history behind it...
- This means Metatest and Sitecheck, kinda hosted with Axolsoft back in the day
- Using google's search console, no real reason I can't just 'ask' for the HTML to be dropped in for analysis, so I went that way
- Much much easier, no server needed, and no need to deal with CORS
- You are liable for what you run on your own browser, and w/e resulting effects may pop up
