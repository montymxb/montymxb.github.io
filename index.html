		Another project I have recently rebooted is one which I am very excited about. 
		As a software designer, it's key that you get up to speed with others and make sure that you're on the same page when discussing a concept.
		Frequently this can be weakest link in a project, and often times there are a series of miscommunications that may occur along the way that can set you and others back quite a ways.
		This is not necessarily our fault, as we are only human. 
		The programming and scripting languages we work with are a concession we must give in order to be able to work with the various devices around us.
		A computer cannot fully understand us out of the box, and likewise we cannot understand it without learning the means of communicating with it.
		These languages can be understood in time, and to some they become as rudimentary as any conversation in a spoken language, but there is a faster means to understand what we are working with.
		However replacing a language altogether is a rather large task and that's not the result that I am looking.<br><br>
		What I am looking for is a way to change the way we interpret that language. 
		To take the structure of a file, a series of files, or an entire project, and represent it in a means which is universally understood.
		The concept is simple, show someone an apple, üçé, and the visual instantly cues up the appropriate information related to it. 
		Show someone the word 'apple', and they must first read it before they can experience the same cue.
		Show the same person '„Ç¢„ÉÉ„Éó„É´', and they must again read it before they can experience the same cue.
		Assuming you know more than one language, you're fine, but if not there's a translation barrier you must first cross.
		My goal is to bypass the visual language interpretation, and to simply show you the üçé.
		The human mind is an amazing thing, and is one of the best pattern matching machines around.
		The mind can put together relations in an image before you are consciously aware of it; like our tendancy for seeing a face from only two circles and a line :).
		To take advantage of such an ability to derive patterns, and to apply it to our everyday work would render immediate improvements, and not just in software either.
		<br><br>
		This Visual Project of mine is something that can benefit software developers and designers, but I believe it will have benefits far outreaching that scope.
		<br><br>

		On another note the latest application I released to Google Play is called "Hangman Azul". The purpose is in the name, it's a hangman game!
		However the azul portion bears significance as well. Azul is spanish for blue, and that color would be the basis for the theme of this app.
		The background is blue and the usage is through bluetooth. The bluetooth part is the primary function, as this is only a multiplayer game.
		I attempted to start something like this over a year ago, but was unable to realize it. Earlier this year I revisited the idea and was able to finally get it set up.
		It's currently at an early release, at Version 0.2.1, but it has been in the works for some time now.

		You can check it out for yourself in the Google Play store <a style = "color: #202020; text-decoration: underline;" href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uphouseworks.hangman">here</a>.
