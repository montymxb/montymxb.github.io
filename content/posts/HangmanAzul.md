After Bit Shooter I wanted to see what it would be like to create an entire application interface purely in OpenGL.
This was probably one of my favorite mobile applications that I built, one which created a fully dynamic interface for a Hangman game.

In addition, it gave me an excuse to play around with implementing some bluetooth networking code, and it ended up working out quite well.
Creating the animation of the letter tray at the bottom was really pretty neat too.
